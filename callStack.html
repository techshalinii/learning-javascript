    <h2>Call stack</h2>
    <p>A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.</li>
        <li>Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.</li>
        <li>When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.</li>
    </ul>
    <script>
        function one(){
            console.log("one");
        }
        function two(){
            console.log("two");
        }
        function three(){
            console.log("three");
        }

        one();
        two();
        three();



        function fun1(){
            console.log("fun1");
            fun2();
        }
        function fun2(){
            console.log("fun2");
            fun3();
        }
        function fun3(){
            console.log("fun3");           
        }

        fun1();
        fun2();
