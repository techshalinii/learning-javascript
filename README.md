### JavaScript DOM
HTML is used to structure the web pages and Javascript is used to add behavior to our web pages. When an HTML file is loaded into the browser, the JavaScript can not understand the HTML document directly. So it interprets and interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM), which is created by the browser based on the HTML document.

### JavaScript Events
Events are things that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so your code can react to them.
