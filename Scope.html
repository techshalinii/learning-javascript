    <h2>Global scope</h2>
    <p>
        In a programming environment, the global scope is the scope that contains, and is visible in, all other scopes.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Local scope</h2>
    <p>
        Local scope is a characteristic of variables that makes them local (i.e., the variable name is only bound to its value within a scope which is not the global scope).
